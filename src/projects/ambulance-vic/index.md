In Victoria Ambulance transport isn’t free. One emergency road trip can cost over $1,100 without cover and some health funds don’t cover the full cost of ambulance transport. In 2018 I was engaged service Victoria I to redesign the membership experience making it quicker and easier to join or renew membership.
