Gardiner Architects is a Melbourne-based Architectural practice with a community focus. In 2013 I redesigned their website and visual identity. The identity was developed in collaboration with Paul Gardiner and his team. A responsive website was designed and built using Worpress. I delivered the site with tutorial videos as a reference for team members updating the website and blog into the future.
