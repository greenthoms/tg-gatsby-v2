The Magistrates' Court of Victoria is the lowest court in the Victorian court system, with the County Court of Victoria and the Supreme Court of Victoria respectively judicially higher. The Magistrates' Court is a court of summary jurisdiction.

In 2018 I was engaged by Webplace to redesign the online experience for people attending Magistrates' Court of Victoria.
